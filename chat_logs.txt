[2025-10-01 17:18:47] Q: Can creators update their business information after registration?
A: Yes, creators can update their business information after registration. They can do so by logging in to the creator dashboard and accessing the profile management section. There are two ways to update business information:  1. Upload updated business documents (government ID, business license, etc.) and submit for verification. 2. Edit existing information (email, phone number, bank account details) without submitting for verification. The updated information is saved in the SQL DB and replicated across multiple nodes for high availability. However, certain changes require re-verification (e.g., tax ID, business license) to ensure accuracy and prevent fraud. Users are notified via email and in-app notifications on verification status changes.
