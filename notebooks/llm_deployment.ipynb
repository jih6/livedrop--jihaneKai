        "**Error Handling Examples:**\n",
        "- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid parameters.\n",
        "- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or expired JWT token.\n",
        "- `403 Forbidden`: Accessing another user’s data.\n",
        "- `409 Conflict`: Duplicate order or already registered email.\n",
        "- `429 Too Many Requests`: Exceeded rate limits.\n",
        "- `500 Internal Server Error`: System failure; includes `request_id` for tracing.\n",

        "- Use cursor-based pagination to reduce load.\n",
        "- Cache frequently accessed endpoints (e.g., popular drops).\n",
